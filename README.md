Named list for Node.js 4.0+.

Installation:
```sh
npm install named-list
```

Run tests:
```sh
npm test
```

## Getting started
```js
var NamedList = require('named-list');
```
### NamedList.parse(str)
Parse a named list from a string, return an object.

### A sample named list
* Keys are surrounded by square brackets.
* A key can have zero or multiple value(s).
```
[Key1]
Value 1
Value 2
[Key with spaces]
Value 1
[Key with no value]
[Another key with no value]
```

Result:
```json
{
    "Key1": ["Value 1", "Value 2"],
    "Key with spaces": ["Value 1"],
    "Key with no value": null,
    "Another key with no value": null
}
```

### Use [] to escape square brackets
```
[Key1]
[][I'm not a key]
[Key2]
```

Result:
```json
{
    "Key1": ["[I'm not a key]"],
    "Key2": null
}
```

### Empty lines are simply ignored
```
[Key]

Value

```

Result:
```json
{
    "Key": ["Value"]
}
```
